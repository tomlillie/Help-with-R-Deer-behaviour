# Help-with-R-Deer-behaviour
I have managed to import my data into R but now I am stuck. Please can someone tell me how to do a scatter plot but using more than two columns. Please help!!!

I am new to github and not really sure the following table will show up correctly. Please email tomlillie1990@gmail.com and I can send you the text file.
